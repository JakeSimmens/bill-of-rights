# Knowing Your Bill of Rights

My boys and I have spent the past few months memorizing the Bill of Rights.  This project is a way to check our memorizing skills.

The main focus of this project is using Javascript to compare user entered text to a predetermined string.  The plan is to first check for a perfect match and then be able to focus on smaller chunks of text to point out specific typos or errors.
